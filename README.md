# FundMe Contract

## A Smart-contract that collects and manages funds from multiple contributors


# Introduction

This contract is a smart contract designed to collect and manage ETH contributions from multiple users. It enables decentralized crowdfunding by allowing users to fund the contract, while the contract owner can withdraw the accumulated funds. This project demonstrates core Solidity concepts such as value transfers, access control, and interaction with price feeds for contribution validation.
